In the installer, you can configure some property values as you want.  
These values are saved in 
* `<TOMCAT_PATH>/shared/classes/app-server-xxx.properties` in Tomcat (for CMIS server and search engine).
* `<INSTALL_PATH>/nemakishare/config/nemakishare_config.yml` (for client)

However, you can modify these values and even override the values hidden in WAR file in Tomcat.
