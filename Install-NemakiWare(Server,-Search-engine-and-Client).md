Installer works on multi-platform.  

## Download the installer
Download `install.jar` from
https://github.com/NemakiWare/NemakiWare/releases

## Run the installer
Run `install.jar`

*  Note: In Unix-like system, instead of clicking `install.jar`, please type the following.  
Because a shell script executing `bundle install` command will fail by clicking it.
```sh
$ java -jar <installer/path>/install.jar
```
