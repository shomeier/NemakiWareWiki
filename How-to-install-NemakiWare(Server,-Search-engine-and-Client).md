## Download the installer
https://github.com/NemakiWare/NemakiWare/releases

Installer works on multi-platform.
Run `install.jar`

## Note: In Unix-like system, instead of clicking `install.jar`, please type
```sh
$ java -jar <installer/path>/install.jar
```
Because a shell script executing `bundle install` command will fail by clicking it.
