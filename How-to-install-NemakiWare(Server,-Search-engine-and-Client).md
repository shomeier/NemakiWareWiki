## Download the installer
Installer works on multi-platform.  
Download it from
https://github.com/NemakiWare/NemakiWare/releases

Run `install.jar`


---
*  Note: In Unix-like system, instead of clicking `install.jar`, please type
```sh
$ java -jar <installer/path>/install.jar
```  
  Because a shell script executing `bundle install` command will fail by clicking it.

* Note: At the end of the installation, it might seem to stop and to take much time.  
  It deploys all Rails gem from local cache. Please wait for the moment :)

* Note: In Windows, the installer is going to install Rails by RailsInstaller.  
If it's not needed, cancel it out in the installer pack selection window.
