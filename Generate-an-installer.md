##Architecture
* Installer can be generated automatically from source code.
* We use [IzPack](http://izpack.org/) to generate an installer after some file manipulation.
* You can generate an installer, which is cross-platform itself, in whatever platform(Linux/Mac/Windows).

##Procedure
1. Run `<INSTALL_PAH>/setup/installer/make.sh` or `<INSTALL_PAH>/setup/installer/make.bat` 
2. `<INSTALL_PAH>/setup/installer/install.jar` is created. This is an installer file.

For running the installer, see [Install NemakiWare(Server, Search engine and Client)](https://github.com/NemakiWare/NemakiWare/wiki/Install-NemakiWare%28Server,-Search-engine-and-Client%29)
