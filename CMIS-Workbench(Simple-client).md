[Apache Chemistry](http://chemistry.apache.org/) provides [CMIS Workbench](http://chemistry.apache.org/java/download.html) for test use.  
In fact, it's very useful and provides almost all the client functions apart from user friendly interface.  

* When NemakiWare client causes an error
* Wen you develop NemakiWare by debugging
* When you need only the server and not the client
etc.

that'll be a nice choice.
